# Coffee-Delivery - Rocketseat  🚀

Project created with the help of vite in React.ts was developed during the second
challenge of Rocketseat's ignite course. The main purpose of this challenge is to train
the subjects covered during the course, such as: routes, forms, data sharing, stylized
elements, etc. The application is a small coffee delivery website, where the user has the
possibility to choose 14 varieties of coffees, after which he must fill out a small form with
data such as address and payment method. If everything is correct with the data filled
in, a new window will show final information about the delivery and payment method
chosen and the waiting time to receive the order placed.
